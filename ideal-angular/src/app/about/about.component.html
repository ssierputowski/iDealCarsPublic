    iDealCars is an all-in-one car dealership web application that will allow the dealer to access all of their information and tools in one app. <br>
    The application will be able to manage employees, car and parts inventory, and keep track of service records for the vehicles. <br>
    The employee accessibility will be through an admin user such as a manager, the car salesman, and the mechanic. <br>
    The application will be able to keep track of the employeesâ€™ time on the clock and notify them by email of any service reminders. <br>
    We plan on using the MEAN Stack with the Mongo Database as our framework for the application.<br>
